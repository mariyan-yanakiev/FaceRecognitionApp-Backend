# FaceRecognitionApp

- Full stack app where the front-end is made with React. It utilizes Clarifaiâ€™s facial recognition API and detects faces in photos. There is also a register/login page that saves user information to a database created with PostgreSQL in order to count user's entries (how many times a user has used a photo in the app).

- Languages used for the front-end: React.JS, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3.
- Languages used for the back-end: Node.js, Express.js, SQL(PostgreSQL).
- Background was created with Particles.js library.
